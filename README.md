# tic-tac-toe
A simple and interactive Tic-Tac-Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project implements the classic 3x3 grid game where we take turns to mark 'X' and 'O' on the grid. The objective is to align three symbols either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win the game.
